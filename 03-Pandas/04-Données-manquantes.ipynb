Jusqu'à présent, Pandas utilisait plusieurs valeurs pour représenter les données manquantes : np.nan est utilisé à cet effet pour les données de type float, np.nan ou None pour les données de type object et pd.NaT pour les données de type date. L'objectif de pd.NA est de fournir un indicateur de données \"manquantes\" qui peut être utilisé de manière cohérente pour tous les types de données. pd.NA est actuellement utilisé par les types de données booléennes et entières annulables, ainsi que par le nouveau type de données string."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"78oi1VMheg4a"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":13,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625565622268,"user":{"displayName":"Rod Paris","photoUrl":"","userId":"10535238717210992784"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"BUsQNAjAeg4b","outputId":"5b8818dc-8df5-4366-ba39-1f64201a9e71"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["nan"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["np.nan"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625565622268,"user":{"displayName":"Rod Paris","photoUrl":"","userId":"10535238717210992784"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"Ak4Kuihveg4c","outputId":"04cb0262-c919-4f0c-cb3e-c0f515baef29"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["<NA>"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["pd.NA"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":536,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625565622799,"user":{"displayName":"Rod Paris","photoUrl":"","userId":"10535238717210992784"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"JAuJ9Uq5eg4c","outputId":"69263aef-8a7c-4629-987a-f4d6474113be"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["NaT"]},"execution_count":4,"metadata":{"tags":[]},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["pd.NaT"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4xeiNt3Keg4d"},"source":["----\n","------\n","**Note !
